# PEAMONTO
The PEAM ontology (PEAMONTO) aims at providing a representation structure for describing Autonomous Mobility (AM) use cases to make this knowledge applicable by actors involved in the design, conception, development, test and validation of innovative mobility and transportation solutions. PEAMONTO serves as a common ground which involves concepts from the Autonomous Mobility (AM) domain.

# GUCO
The GUCO module serves as a meta module for use cases. GUCO provides a generic reference for describing use cases of any type. These can be applied to domain-specific modules.

# Application
PEAMONTO extends GUCO to the mobility and transportation domain and is currently applied in a tool for designing and comparing different use cases and applications in that domain.
