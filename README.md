# About

The peamonto project aims at exploring and classifying concepts for the conception, implementation and testing of autonomous mobility and transportation solutions. The project follows a use case oriented approach which involves the development of a generic use case module (GUCO). GUCO can be linked to domain modules such as PEAMONTO, further introduced in this research. The ontologies are tested alongside a use case tool currently under development, and subject to further research.

This research work has been submitted to the 2024 FOIS conference and is awaiting feedback for acceptance.

# PEAMONTO
The PEAM ontology (PEAMONTO) aims at providing a representation structure for describing Autonomous Mobility (AM) use cases to make this knowledge applicable by actors involved in the design, conception, development, test and validation of innovative mobility and transportation solutions. PEAMONTO serves as a common ground which involves concepts from the Autonomous Mobility (AM) domain.

PEAMONTO is accessible on: <https://marc-ga.github.io/peamonto/peamonto.owl>

Version 1.0 of the PEAMONTO module corresponds to commit id 7669aa7 and is accessible [here](https://github.com/Marc-GA/peamonto/commit/7669aa7040913fa18271b4689b1cecd5a95edcf9).

# GUCO
The GUCO module serves as a meta module for use cases. GUCO provides a generic reference for describing use cases of any type. These can be applied to domain-specific modules.

GUCO is accessible on: <https://marc-ga.github.io/peamonto/guco.owl>

Version 1.0 of the GUCO module corresponds to commit id d13c153 and is accessible [here](https://github.com/Marc-GA/peamonto/commit/d13c15318825deb3a7251e37d5518c73f5ae6032).

# Application
PEAMONTO extends GUCO to the mobility and transportation domain and is currently applied in a tool for designing and comparing different use cases and applications in that domain.
